This is a Discord bot that lets you play the card game "Love Letter" in your Discord server. It is made in Python and takes advantage of Discord's APIs. 

When prompted, it creates private channels for each player in the game where they are prompted for input on their turn. 

Love Letter is a game of bluffing and secret information, so it's important that each player has a channel unique to them to keep the information private.
